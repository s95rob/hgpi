# hgpi

A thin common abstraction layer over multiple rendering APIs. This project is early-stage, and is subject to change frequently. The idea is to create a D3D11-like API that supports multiple platforms/driver configurations. 

### TODO:
+ Implement full API spec over D3D11
+ SPIRV-Cross integration, use SPIR-V shaders as native shader byte code
+ Vulkan implementation
